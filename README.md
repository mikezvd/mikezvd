## ðŸ“‚ Contents

This repository includes a public notebook reproducing the simulation described in **Appendix B** of the manuscript:

- `agent_convergence_simulation.ipynb`:  
  Demonstrates the recursive alignment of memory between two agents exposed to identical entropy flows. This supports the theoretical prediction of exponential fixed-point convergence in recursive observer systems.

## ðŸ§ª Running the Notebook

To run the simulation locally:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
jupyter notebook observer_convergence_simulation.ipynb
