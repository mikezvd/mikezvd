# Hey, I'm Miguel 👋🏼

Most of my work lives at the intersection of:

- 🧠 Consciousness research  
- 🔁 Recursive systems & entropy  
- 🤖 Emotion-aware AI architecture  
- 🧬 Pattern recognition across disciplines  

I'm currently publishing the **Observer Zero** framework — a new physical model proposing that time, mind, and matter emerge from recursive observation. It combines physics, cognition, and systems thinking into a unified structure for building self-aware systems.

I’m not following a traditional academic path. I’m building what I believe should exist.

If you're curious about where intelligence, ethics, and recursion meet — feel free to reach out or explore the repositories below.
